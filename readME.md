## Description

My motivation for building this project was to use a NoSQL database to create the framework for a social media site. From this project, I learned how to properly route data using a nosql database.

## Installation
After cloning, run npm start and then proceed to insomnia to do the route testing.

## Usage
You may use insomnia to test the routes, add/remove information from the database, and even update it while in the database.
